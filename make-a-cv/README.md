# Make-a-CV

Hi! This is a very simple tool that helps to make a CV, which I made to meet my own needs. It doesn't send
any of the CV data to a server, because there isn't one&mdash;it is statically served by GitHub Pages and uses no
API. I only collect some usage stats which contain no personal or sensitive data.

If you've spot a bug, have a suggestion, or want to chat about the tool, feel free to contact me by
<a href="mailto:teymur@bayra.mov?subject=Regarding Make-a-CV: [your summary goes here]">email</a>,
or [create](https://github.com/tbayramov/tbayramov.github.io/issues) a GitHub issue
(make sure to add a `make-a-cv` label).

A preview is available below the editor. CV data is auto-saved **locally** (browser's
[local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API))
and you can save it in JSON format  by clicking *Export JSON*. You can then import it to continue editing
or make adjustments.

To save your CV as PDF you can click *Print* and select "Printing to PDF" (feature availability depends on
the OS)&mdash;this will also set 10pt font size and leave only CV on the page. Directly invoking the print dialog
works the same.

Each input accepts HTML.
